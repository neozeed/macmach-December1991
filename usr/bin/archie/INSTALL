 This is the minimal set of things you need for an archie client using
the Prospero system.  It is derived from the 4.2beta version of the
full Prospero system, currently available in:

	cs.washington.edu:/pub/prospero.tar.Z

 To make the client:

	- edit the Makefile, changing CC, OPTIONS, LDFLAGS, and RM if
	  necessary
	- edit the DEFINEs as necessary
	- add the line
		dirsrv			1525/udp
	  to your system's services file (recommended, but not
	  absolutely necessary; it will default to this)
	- if you're closer to Finland or Australia than you are
	  Canada, please edit ARCHIE_HOST in archie.h appropriately
	- type `make'

 Note that if you build this using gcc on Suns, you *must* compile dirsend.c
with the Sun compiler and not the GNU one.  The current version of GNU C
doesn't fully support Sun's structure passing; as a result, the inet_ntoa()
function used in dirsend.c will segmentation fault.  (Aka, you're probably
better off just building the whole thing with /bin/cc anyway right now.)

 It's been successfully built on:

 (I have it *almost* working under VMS with Multinet TCP.  I haven't found
  a good select() yet---once I get that, it'll work.  Contributions? :) )
