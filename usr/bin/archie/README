 Enclosed you'll find a Prospero client for the archie service.  It'll
let you query the archie databases without actually using an
interactive process on the remote server's machine (e.g. archie.mcgill.ca)
resulting in a MUCH better response time.  It also helps lessen the
load on the archie server.

 George Ferguson has completed a cool X archie client; it's nearly
ready for release.  A curses implementation of his interface is also
currently being developed.

 This is a third child of Clifford Neuman's Prospero project.  It's really
the Archie client that's included in the prospero stuff, but I've taken out
everything that's unnecessary for this client to work.  (Aka, you don't
have to build all of Prospero to get the Archie client.)  Khun Yee Fung
also wrote an archie client, but in Perl.

 Also, using the Archie Prospero interface in its true form will probably be
of interest---check out the file `Prospero' for an example of its interface.
If it's of interest, you should probably get the full prospero kit from
the University of Washington on cs.washington.edu in pub/prospero.tar.Z.

 Suffice to say, there are now a number of ways to query Archie without
bogging the server down with your logins.

 Check out the man page for instructions on how to use this archie client.

 If you have any questions about Archie itself, write to 
archie-l@cs.mcgill.ca.  If you have questions about Prospero, write to
info-prospero@isi.edu.  If you have questions about this
specific package, write to brendan@cs.widener.edu (Brendan Kehoe).
