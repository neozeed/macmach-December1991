/* Notes on the algorithm used in wait_for_inferior to determine if we
   just did a subroutine call when stepping.  We have the following
   information at that point:

                  Current and previous (just before this step) pc.
		  Current and previous sp.
		  Current and previous start of current function.

   If the start's of the functions don't match, then

   	a) We did a subroutine call.

   In this case, the pc will be at the beginning of a function.

	b) We did a subroutine return.

   Otherwise.

	c) We did a longjmp.

   If we did a longjump, we were doing "nexti", since a next would
   have attempted to skip over the assembly language routine in which
   the longjmp is coded and would have simply been the equivalent of a
   continue.  I consider this ok behaivior.  We'd like one of two
   things to happen if we are doing a nexti through the longjmp()
   routine: 1) It behaves as a stepi, or 2) It acts like a continue as
   above.  Given that this is a special case, and that anybody who
   thinks that the concept of sub calls is meaningful in the context
   of a longjmp, I'll take either one.  Let's see what happens.  

   Acts like a subroutine return.  I can handle that with no problem
   at all.

   -->So: If the current and previous beginnings of the current
   function don't match, *and* the pc is at the start of a function,
   we've done a subroutine call.  If the pc is not at the start of a
   function, we *didn't* do a subroutine call.  

   -->If the beginnings of the current and previous function do match,
   either: 

   	a) We just did a recursive call.

	   In this case, we would be at the very beginning of a
	   function and 1) it will have a prologue (don't jump to
	   before prologue, or 2) (we assume here that it doesn't have
	   a prologue) there will have been a change in the stack
	   pointer over the last instruction.  (Ie. it's got to put
	   the saved pc somewhere.  The stack is the usual place.  In
	   a recursive call a register is only an option if there's a
	   prologue to do something with it.  This is even true on
	   register window machines; the prologue sets up the new
	   window.  It might not be true on a register window machine
	   where the call instruction moved the register window
	   itself.  Hmmm.  One would hope that the stack pointer would
	   also change.  If it doesn't, somebody send me a note, and
	   I'll work out a more general theory.
	   bug-gdb@prep.ai.mit.edu).  This is true (albeit slipperly
	   so) on all machines I'm aware of:

	      m68k:	Call changes stack pointer.  Regular jumps don't.

	      sparc:	Recursive calls must have frames and therefor,
	                prologues.

	      vax:	All calls have frames and hence change the
	                stack pointer.

	b) We did a return from a recursive call.  I don't see that we
	   have either the ability or the need to distinguish this
	   from an ordinary jump.  The stack frame will be printed
	   when and if the frame pointer changes; if we are in a
	   function without a frame pointer, it's the users own
	   lookout.

	c) We did a jump within a function.  We assume that this is
	   true if we didn't do a recursive call.

	d) We are in no-man's land ("I see no symbols here").  We
	   don't worry about this; it will make calls look like simple
	   jumps (and the stack frames will be printed when the frame
	   pointer moves), which is a reasonably non-violent response.

#if 0
    We skip this; it causes more problems than it's worth.
#ifdef SUN4_COMPILER_FEATURE
    We do a special ifdef for the sun 4, forcing it to single step
  into calls which don't have prologues.  This means that we can't
  nexti over leaf nodes, we can probably next over them (since they
  won't have debugging symbols, usually), and we can next out of
  functions returning structures (with a "call .stret4" at the end).
