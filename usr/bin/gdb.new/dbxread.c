/* This module provides three functions: dbx_symfile_init,
   which initializes to read a symbol file; dbx_new_init, which 
   discards existing cached information when all symbols are being
   discarded; and dbx_symfile_read, which reads a symbol table
   from a file.

   dbx_symfile_read only does the minimum work necessary for letting the
   user "name" things symbolically; it does not read the entire symtab.
   Instead, it reads the external and static symbols and puts them in partial
   symbol tables.  When more extensive information is requested of a
   file, the corresponding partial symbol table is mutated into a full
   fledged symbol table by going back and reading the symbols
   for real.  dbx_psymtab_to_symtab() is the function that does this */

	 the called function wants an int or a short), so there
	 is no practical difference between an int and a short
	 (except perhaps what happens when the GDB user types
	 "print short_arg = 0x10000;"). 

	 Hacked for SunOS 4.1 by gnu@cygnus.com.  In 4.1, the compiler
	 actually produces the correct address (we don't need to fix it
	 up).  I made this code adapt so that it will offset the symbol
