   This function can be queued N times as a cleanup, or called
   directly; it will do all the work the first time, and then will be a
   no-op until the next time it is queued.  This works by bumping a
   counter at queueing time.  Much later when the cleanup is run, or at
   the end of symbol processing (in case the cleanup is discarded), if
   the queued count is greater than the "done-count", we do the work
   and set the done-count to the queued count.  If the queued count is
   less than or equal to the done-count, we just ignore the call.  This
   is needed because reading a single .o file will often replace many
   symtabs (one per .h file, for example), and we don't want to reset
   the breakpoints N times in the user's face.

   The reason we both queue a cleanup, and call it directly after symbol
