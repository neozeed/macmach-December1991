/* sparc_frame_find_saved_regs ()

   Stores, into a struct frame_saved_regs,
   the addresses of the saved registers of frame described by FRAME_INFO.
   This includes special registers such as pc and fp saved in special
   ways in the stack frame.  sp is even more special:
   the address we return for it IS the sp for the next frame.

   Note that on register window machines, we are currently making the
   assumption that window registers are being saved somewhere in the
   frame in which they are being used.  If they are stored in an
   inferior frame, find_saved_register will break.

   On the Sun 4, the only time all registers are saved is when
   a dummy frame is involved.  Otherwise, the only saved registers
   are the LOCAL and IN registers which are saved as a result
   of the "save/restore" opcodes.  This condition is determined
   by address rather than by value.

   The "pc" is not stored in a frame on the SPARC.  (What is stored
   is a return address minus 8.)  sparc_pop_frame knows how to
   deal with that.  Other routines might or might not.

   See tm-sparc.h (PUSH_FRAME and friends) for CRITICAL information
   about how this works.  */
