 * Copyright (C) 1991, Thomas G. Lane.
 * This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
 * For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.
 *
 * This file contains simple error-reporting and trace-message routines.
 * These are suitable for Unix-like systems and others where writing to
 * stderr is the right thing to do.  If the JPEG software is integrated
 * into a larger application, you may well need to replace these.
 *
 * The error_exit() routine should not return to its caller.  Within a
 * larger application, you might want to have it do a longjmp() to return
 * control to the outer user interface routine.  This should work since
 * the portable JPEG code doesn't use setjmp/longjmp.  However, this won't
 * release allocated memory or close temp files --- some bookkeeping would
 * need to be added to the memory manager module to make that work.
 *
 * These routines are used by both the compression and decompression code.
