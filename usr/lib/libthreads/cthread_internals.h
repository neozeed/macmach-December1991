 * HISTORY
 * $Log:	cthread_internals.h,v $
 * Revision 2.11  91/08/28  11:19:23  jsb
 * 	Fixed MACH_CALL to allow multi-line expressions.
 * 	[91/08/23            rpd]
 * 
 * Revision 2.10  91/07/31  18:33:33  dbg
 * 	Protect against redefinition of ASSERT.
 * 	[91/07/30  17:33:21  dbg]
 * 
 * Revision 2.9  91/05/14  17:56:24  mrt
 * 	Correcting copyright
 * 
 * Revision 2.8  91/02/14  14:19:42  mrt
 * 	Added new Mach copyright
 * 	[91/02/13  12:41:02  mrt]
 * 
 * Revision 2.7  90/11/05  14:36:55  rpd
 * 	Added spin_lock_t.
 * 	[90/10/31            rwd]
 * 
 * Revision 2.6  90/09/09  14:34:51  rpd
 * 	Remove special field.
 * 	[90/08/24            rwd]
 * 
 * Revision 2.5  90/06/02  15:13:44  rpd
 * 	Converted to new IPC.
 * 	[90/03/20  20:52:47  rpd]
 * 
 * Revision 2.4  90/03/14  21:12:11  rwd
 * 	Added waiting_for field for debugging deadlocks.
 * 	[90/03/01            rwd]
 * 	Added list field to keep a master list of all cprocs.
 * 	[90/03/01            rwd]
 * 
 * Revision 2.3  90/01/19  14:37:08  rwd
 * 	Keep track of real thread for use in thread_* substitutes.
 * 	Add CPROC_ARUN for about to run and CPROC_HOLD to avoid holding
 * 	spin_locks over system calls.
 * 	[90/01/03            rwd]
 * 	Add busy field to be used by cthread_msg calls to make sure we
 * 	have the right number of blocked kernel threads.
 * 	[89/12/21            rwd]
 * 
 * Revision 2.2  89/12/08  19:53:28  rwd
 * 	Added CPROC_CONDWAIT state
 * 	[89/11/28            rwd]
 * 	Added on_special field.
 * 	[89/11/26            rwd]
 * 	Removed MSGOPT conditionals
 * 	[89/11/25            rwd]
 * 	Removed old debugging code.  Add wired port/flag.  Add state
 * 	for small state machine.
 * 	[89/10/30            rwd]
 * 	Added CPDEBUG code
 * 	[89/10/26            rwd]
 * 	Change TRACE to {x;} else.
 * 	[89/10/24            rwd]
 * 	Rewrote to work for limited number of kernel threads.  This is
 * 	basically a merge of coroutine and thread.  Added
 * 	cthread_receivce call for use by servers.
 * 	[89/10/23            rwd]
