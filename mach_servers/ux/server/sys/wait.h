 * HISTORY
 * $Log:	wait.h,v $
 * Revision 2.1  89/08/04  14:50:17  rwd
 * Created.
 * 
 * Revision 2.2  88/08/24  02:55:25  mwyoung
 * 	Adjusted include file references.
 * 	[88/08/17  02:29:35  mwyoung]
 * 
 *
 * 06-Jan-88  Jay Kistler (jjk) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *	Made file reentrant.  Added declarations for __STDC__.
 *
 * 28-Jan-87  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	CS_GENERIC: Defined new WLOGINDEV option bit for wait3().
 *	[ V5.1(F1) ]
 *
 * 14-Dec-86  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Merged romp and 68000 definitions since they were the same.
 *	The real conditional should be dependent on byte ordering.
 *
 * 30-May-86  Jonathan J. Chew (jjc) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added 68000 dependent definitions of w_t and w_S very similar to
 *	those for the ROMP.
 *
 * 19-Feb-86  Bill Bolosky (bolosky) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added alternate definitions of w_T and w_S for Sailboat under
 *	switch ROMP.
